# Hi there, 
### Welcome to my Github page!

I'm a passionate frontend developer and I have set my mind on further develop my skills. In 2020 I've decided it was time for me to switch gears and give my career a new direction. With a background in product development and business marketing I have a broad perspective on development processes and a good eye for design which comes in handy as a web developer. Codaisseur code academy has given me a jump start in achieving my goal to become a developer. In a 11 week program I developed a fundamental web development skillset that has enabled me to make advanced react web and native applications. Now 3 years along the road FE development still interests me and I can't wait to discover more in the field.

Currently I'm working as a frontend developer (mr) at Small Giants, building static generated web applications with mainly NextJs. I'm managing teams and projects and have succesfully deployed multiple recruitment websites.
